Welcome to my webpage! :wave: I'm delighted to introduce myself â€“ I am Asgher Ali, a dedicated Adjunct Faculty at the Department of Mathematics within the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, nestled within the vibrant academic landscape of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). My intellectual pursuits revolve around the captivating realm of optimal control, specifically as it pertains to continuous models stemming from antibiotic and radiobiological dosing challenges.

With a fervent curiosity for the practical applications of mathematics, I am driven to bridge the gap between theory and real-world impact. The complex landscapes of antibiotic and radiobiological dosing have captivated my attention, propelling me to explore optimal control methodologies that hold the potential to revolutionize healthcare strategies and deepen our understanding of biological systems.

My journey is not confined to the theoretical alone. My explorations encompass a diverse array of interests, ranging from computational mathematics and numerical optimization to the intricacies of data-driven partial differential equation solutions. I find great fulfillment in engaging with modeling and simulations, as well as diving into the depths of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling.

<p><strong>Research interests</strong>: computational mathematics, numerical optimization, neural network inspired PDEs solution, modeling and simulations, optimal control theory, parameter estimation, stochastic modeling.

<p><strong>Let me know if you have an open post doc position on these (or adjacent) topics.</strong>
