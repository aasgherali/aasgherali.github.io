For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
Oh yeah 

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

I have to update it now!
